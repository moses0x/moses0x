### Hi there!

I'm Moses. I work as a frontend engineer in training and a student of computer science. 

In my spare time, I’m an autodidact and love to read engineering blogs + watch YouTube videos to see what’s new in the Javascript ecosystem. I do open-sourcing.

I love to work on [solutions](https://github.com/moses0x/) that drive progress and make a tangible impact. Having a track record of initiating and leading successful projects & teams; I thrive in challenging, fast-paced environments.

There are also [other projects]([https://github.com/moses0x/](https://github.com/moses0x/) that I've developed for fun but that you might find useful, like ✍🏻 [hello.app]([https://github.com/moses0x/](https://github.com/moses0x/)) online drawing app.

I also write 📝 [articles](https://dev.to/moses0x) about life, web development and technology.
